## Presentation Guidelines

Project presentations are very different than the technical reviews. Technical
reviews are about communicating specific design or code issues so that the
audience would have enough information to help you with these decisions.
Project presentations will largely be a one-way street. You will be crafting
your presentation to tell the audience about the current state of your project
in a smooth, engaging, and professional manner. Here are some bullet points to
keep in mind:

* You will have ~7 minutes to present and ~1.5 minutes to answer a quick question or two per presentation.
* Everyone will be presenting from one laptop (one set up in AC326, and one set up in AC328) the same laptop. You should upload your slides to the [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-kMZWl84ibOaUZONFE3TFE1Z28?usp=sharing) beforehand. Acceptable formats are Powerpoint, PDF, and Google presentation.
* As a consequence of the previous point, no live demos! As an alternative, we suggest using a screen capture program (such as [this](http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/) one) to highlight what your software can do so far. You should then upload your screen capture to YouTube so that it can be shown during your presentation.
* Not everyone knows about your project! Your presentation should provide motivation and context for your project.
* If you are using algorithms, libraries, or technologies that were not explicitly taught as part of the class, make sure to properly explain them. Given the duration of the presentation, you might have to gloss over some details (this is okay!). Be strategic about how deeply you explain various aspects of your system.
* A brief overview of your code architecture is always welcome. Just don't get too bogged down into unimportant details.
* Include some information about what you plan to do by the Software Design Expo.
* Be professional.
* Be energetic and excited. This is your time to get the class excited about your project.

As an audience member, your job is to be engaged and provide presentation
feedback. You will be able to communicate feedback to the presenters using a
Google form (link to be posted). So, make sure to have your laptop charged and
ready to go.

## Rubric

**The Big Idea (25%)**

Clearly and succinctly communicate the motivation for your project providing
context to appropriately target your audience.

**Implementation and Design Details (25%)**

Provide the details of how you are implementing your project at a level of
detail appropriate for the audience and the time frame of the presentation.
These details might include the libraries you are using, the algorithms you
are implementing, or the object-oriented architecture you have employed.

**Project status (25%)**

Communicate the status of your project including:

* what you have done so far (possibly including screenshots or a video demo)
* current work
* future work /reach goals

**Professionalism**  (25%)

Communicate with your audience in a professional manner. Since this is not a
super-formal presentation, jokes and fun are certainly fair game, however,
your presentation should not be be jokey at the expense of being clear,
informative, and earnest. Also, inappropriate jokes are inappropriate! A good
rule of thumb is to shoot for something that you would be proud to present to
your parents.
