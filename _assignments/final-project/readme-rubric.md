Every software project should include a README, to give context for the
project and help people get started using it. README files are helpful for
your users and other developers - including yourself in the future! Elements
of a good README include:

**Title**

* Clear, descriptive, unambiguous, memorable

**Description**

* "What does it do", including some context

**Authors**

* Could include links to e.g. personal portfolio site.
* Includes attribution for code you did not write.

**Getting Started**

* Download instructions, optionally including versioning information and/or checksums.
* Installation instructions, including any required dependencies. You may assume that users start with the same environment you had on day 1 of the class. If your code depends on additional Ubuntu packages that are installed via `apt-get install`, include a `sudo apt-get install x y z` one-liner in the README. If you installed additional Python packages, list these in a [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) file, and include a `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` one-liner in the README.

**Usage**

* Provide examples of how to run the code and expected results
* Describe any required input/output files.

**License**

* Your final project represents a fair amount of your hard work, so you should think a bit about the terms on which you want to release it into the world. Check out <http://choosealicense.com>


## Developer-centric options

If you want others to contribute to your code, consider adding some of these
additional sections:

**How to Contribute**

* Explicit instructions on the type of help you're looking for and how you'd like to receive it.

**Changelog**

* Description of what changed with each version. Since you're using git, this can largely be replaced by quality commit messages.

**Implementation Details**

* How the code works at a more detailed level.
* Description of files, data structures, etc. that it is important for new developers to be familiar with.


### Other options

A few other sections that you could choose to include:

* List of Frequently-Asked Questions
* Links to peer/related projects
* Advertising "flavor text" promoting your work
* Multi-lingual information
* Tip jar :)
