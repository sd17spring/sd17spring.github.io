## Keep Calm and SoftDes On

Before we can get down to the business, we need to make sure we have the right
tools for the job. If you follow these instructions (with help from our
amazing NINJA team), your computer will be primed and ready to do some serious
computational work.

Initially, the amount of new stuff here may seem intimidating. Please do not
let this discourage you! We (NINJAs and faculty) will provide lots of help and
guidance along the way to help you setup, and then gain comfort with your new
toolset. The process will start at the end of the first class, and will
continue with additional NINJA / faculty office hours to help you complete the
process successfully. Additionally, you will gain familiarity and comfort with
this toolset as the semester progresses. In other words, you should think of
learning the toolset as a process and not something that you need to do all at
once.


### A note about variations on the instructions

The instructions below will allow you to setup the "officially supported"
environment for SoftDes. Some deviations from the setup below are okay while
others are not (when in doubt please ask). That being said, it will likely be
more difficult for us to help you debug problems with your setup if you have a
nonstandard environment.


### A note about "`$`"

In these instructions we will use a "`$`" to indicate that a command should be
performed at the Linux command prompt. If a command is not preceded with a "`$`"
then it is understood that it is a Python statement (even without this marker,
the context should make it clear whether a command is a Linux command or a
Python command). For instance, we might instruct you to run the following
command.

``` bash
$ ls ~
```

In this case you would open a Linux terminal and type the characters "`ls ~`"
and then hit the enter key (notice that you don't actually type the "`$`" at any
time). If you don't know what a Linux terminal is yet, that is okay! Keep
reading!


## Step 1: Install and Configure Ubuntu

The officially supported OS for SoftDes is Ubuntu 16.04.1 64-bit (ISO
available [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/ubuntu-16.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso)).
The preferred method for installation is to use one of the
provided SoftDes thumb drives. These thumb drives have been pre-loaded with a
bootable installer for Ubuntu 16.04.1. In order to go forward with the
installation you need to insert the thumb drive, reboot your computer, and
hold the F12 key before your computer starts to load Windows. You will now be
at your computer's BIOS menu. Use the arrow keys to select boot from "USB
Storage Device". If everything has gone properly, the Ubuntu installer will
start. You may find IT's [instructions](http://wikis.olin.edu/linux/doku.php)
useful for completing the installation steps.

First-year laptops seem to have enough free space on the hard drive to install
Linux, so you can just follow the default "Install Linux alongside Windows"
instructions. If you have an older laptop or otherwise don't have room for the
Linux install, you will need to adjust your hard drive partition sizes to make
room. Detailed instructions on how to complete the partitioning process can be
found [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/343268/how-to-use-manual-partitioning-during-installation/343370#343370).
When in doubt ask for help as this part is a bit tricky.

Another option is to use a [virtual
machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine). In this variant you
will run Ubuntu inside of a window inside of the Windows operating system (or
Mac OS X if that is what you have). We will also have thumb drives on hand
that can be used to install Ubuntu as a virtual machine. We recommend the
freely available program [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) if you are
running a VM. Ask for help if you find you need help on setting this up.

The steps that are most important are:

* Configure apt
* Install the proprietary NVIDIA driver
* Enable your firewall
* Configure wireless

You can set up the other things later if you want to.

Once everything is configured, execute the following commands at the Linux
terminal:

``` bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Next, install some additional Python packages using the following commands:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y python python-pip python-tk python-dev git build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-tk python3-dev
```

Note, that the preceding command installs these key pieces of software:

* **Git** is the version control system we will use this semester.
* **python3-pip** is a Python package installer.
* **python3-tk** is a GUI toolkit for Python.
* **python-pip** and **python-tk** are the package installers and GUI for Python 2.
We won't be coding in Python 2 in this course, but we may use it to run student projects
from previous years.

Next, we'll install Jupyter notebook which you'll be using for pre-class
exercises:

``` bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip3 install jupyter
```

We'll be using Atom as default text editor for the course. Go ahead and install it:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install atom
```

To verify that Python 3 is installed, run:

```
$ python3
```

Then type the following at the Python prompt:

``` python
>>> import turtle
>>> turtle.Turtle()
>>> quit()
```

Notes:

* Don't type the `>>>`. (`>>>` is to Python as `$` is to bash.)
* The `turtle.Turtle()` line will cause a white window to appear in front of the terminal window.
Since you'll need to switch back to the terminal window to continue interacting with the Python prompt, you can close the white window.

To verify that Atom is installed, run:

``` bash
$ atom
```


## Optional: Set Up Your Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You've now got all you need to start editing code with Atom, but you may want your development environment to be a little fancier. Beyond a simple text editor, an IDE also contains a suite of tools that will help you debug while you code instead of discovering the errors at runtime.

Certain trivial but frequent errors (incorrect indentation, certain misspelled names) can be detected earlier. We'll transform Atom into a pseudo-IDE by installing some development tools that let you see these errors in the editor as you type.

``` bash
$ sudo pip3 install pyflakes jedi flake8 isort
$ apm install Hydrogen atom-beautify autocomplete autocomplete-python script
$ apm install linter linter-flake8 python-indent python-isort python-tools trailing-spaces
```

[`script` was added to the instructions above on 2017-01-29.
If you followed these instructions before that date, you need to run
`apm install script` to get it.]

If you prefer to use Sublime Text, install a _plugin manager_ (Package Control) using [these
instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3), and install the
[Anaconda](http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/) plugin using [these
instructions](http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/#using-anaconda-installation).
This plugin can also provide additional programming aids; for more information, see the
[Anaconda](http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/) web site.

{% if site.data.course.urls.floobits %}
## Optional: Setup Floobits

Occasionally, we (the instructors) will be coding in front of the class. In
the past it has been difficult to write code that is longer than can fit on
the projector screen at once. The reason for this is that once the code gets
longer than this length, students can no longer view the entire program all at
once. Instead they must rely upon the instructor to scroll around if they want
to review various parts of the program. In order to combat this problem, we
are going to be using [Floobits](https://floobits.com/). Floobits will allow
you to follow along on your computer live as we do coding in front of the
class. You can either follow along on the web or within your favorite
development environment. The cool thing is that if you follow along in your
favorite development environment then you will be able to run the code on your
computer as we go.

To setup Floobits, first you should create an account on GitHub (this is
something you will have to do for your next assignment, so you might as well
get a jump on it!).

Finally, follow [these](https://floobits.com/help/plugins/atom) (brief)
instructions to configure the plugin.

## Step 2: Learn About Linux

Read Chapter 1 of Linux at Olin (available [here]({% link files/assignments/setup-your-environment/linux.pdf %})).


## Step 3: Get Started with Git

### The Basic Idea

We will make heavy use of Git (and GitHub in this class). Haven't heard of
Git? That's totally fine (and totally expected)! Before we do some course
specific Git stuff, take some time to read [Chapter
1](https://github.com/AllenDowney/amgit/blob/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.markdown)
of Allen's excellent online book called AmGit.


### Create a GitHub Account

Now that you have the basic idea of what version control is and what it is
good for, you are going to take the next step and sign up for an account on a
website called [GitHub](https://github.com/). The second chapter of Allen's
book has a nice description of GitHub, and how to make an account.

> GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git users. In general a hosting
service provides storage space on remote servers, network access, and tools
and applications for interacting with stored data. GitHub provides storage for
Git repositories and tools for interacting with them.
>
> There are other hosting services for Git, but GitHub is one of the most
popular. It is so popular that people sometimes say "GitHub" when they mean
"Git", so just to be clear:
>
> * Git is an application that runs on your computer and helps you manage
repositories.
> * You can use Git to manage repos stored on your own computer or on any
computer configured as a Git server.
> * Anybody can set up and run a Git server. A company that runs Git servers
professionally is a Git hosting service.
> * GitHub is one of many Git hosting services.
>
> Ok, go to <https://github.com>. If you already have an account, log in.
Otherwise, you will have to create one.
>
> You can choose any available username you like, but there are a few things
you might want to think about:
>
> 1. Working on GitHub involves interacting with other people. They will see
your username, so choose wisely.
> 2. Some people, like `AllenDowney`, use their full names, but the most
common schema seems to be one-word lower-case usernames. For example, Scott
Chacon is `schacon`.
> 3. If you want to be anonymous, you can choose a username unrelated to
your real name; however,
> 4. Many software engineers use GitHub as part of their professional
portfolio. If a potential employer wants to check out your skills, they might
look at your GitHub repositories.
>
> It is probably a good idea to think of everything you do on GitHub as part
of your public professional reputation.


### Find and Fork the ReadingJournal Repo

We will be using GitHub for a number of use cases in the class.

* Turning in pre-class reading exercises
* Turning in mini-projects
* Distributing materials for in-class exercises

Since there's reading due next class, you will need to perform the steps below
to setup your personal `ReadingJournal` repository.

Navigate to the SoftDes reading journal base repository by clicking on this
[link](https://github.com/{{site.data.course.github_owner}}/ReadingJournal). Next, click the "Fork"
button in the upper right hand corner of the page. If you are not signed into
GitHub, you will be prompted to sign in. Read on for instructions on
downloading and then turning in your reading exercises.


## Step 4: Do Some Reading (and write Some Python)!

Now that you've created a fork of the ReadingJournal repo, you should clone it
to your desktop. In the web browser window that you used to fork the base
repo, copy the URL that points to your fork of that repo. For Paul, the URL
looks like this: `https://github.com/paulruvolo/ReadingJournal.git`. He got this
link by copying the highlighted text in the screenshot below.

[![]({% link images/assignments/setup-your-environment/screenshot.png %})]({% link images/assignments/setup-your-environment/screenshot.png %})

Next, open up a terminal and clone the repo by running the following command
(be sure to replace the pointer to Paul's ReadingJournal with your own!). These
instructions assume that you want to put the Reading Journal in your home
directory. If not, make sure to modify the first line to change to the
directory where you want your reading journal to reside.

``` bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/paulruvolo/ReadingJournal.git
```

Next, you can fire up Jupyter notebook and load the reading journal for today.

``` bash
$ cd ~/ReadingJournal
$ jupyter notebook day1_reading_journal.ipynb
```

If all goes well, this should bring up a web browser with the reading
questions as well as an Jupyter notebook you can use for taking your own notes
on the reading.

Once you have completed your reading journal (not just the reading exercises,
but also your notes as well as any comments you want to give to us), you can
turn in your work by running the following commands:

``` bash
$ cd ~/ReadingJournal
$ git add day1_reading_journal.ipynb
$ git commit -m "Turning in my reading journal for day 1"
$ git push
```

You will then be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Assuming
you followed all of the instructions outlined above, that's it!

**Note: just for this time, there is one last step to turning in your reading assignment. This additional step will happen when you fill out the course entrance survey (see below).**


### Contingency Plan if You Are Having Problems With Your Setup

If you are having trouble getting your environment setup for whatever reason,
please do the following:

1. Tell us about it immediately! The teaching team (NINJAs and faculty) can help you (the best way to contact the whole teaching team is through Piazza).
2. Don't fall behind on the reading in ThinkPython. In order to make sure this doesn't happen, we have put up a hosted version of the Jupyter journal notebooks. You can access it [here](http://mybinder.org/repo/{{site.data.course.github_owner}}/ReadingJournal). Please note that your work will not be saved on the sever as you fill the notebook out. If you want to get a snapshot of your work, it is important to download the notebook file to your computer (the download command is under the file menu). It's probably best to think of this as a scratch pad, and not as the sole place to store your work.


## Step 5: Play a game?!?

President Obama made
[headlines](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/12/10/president-obama-first-president-write-line-code)
for being the first U.S. president to write a line
of code. The code he wrote was part of the "[Hour of
Code](http://hourofcode.com/us)" initiative which seeks to get more people to
try programming. There are many different hour of code tutorials, but a really
fun one is called [LightBot](http://lightbot.com/hocflash.html). Go ahead and
try it out! While LightBot might seem trivial at first (the first few levels
pretty much are that), we think it provides an interesting jumping off point
for some interesting discussions regarding how to approach computational
problems (the first section called "Basics" is very easy, so please make sure
to try out a few of the "Procedures" levels as well). Here are some things you
might want to ponder as you play the game:

* What processes do you go through to craft your first attempt at a level?
* If your attempt is unsuccessful, how did you go about fixing it?
* Did your approach to the previous two events change as you got more experience playing the game?
* Any other interesting observations?

## Tell Us More About Yourself!

As a final step for both turning in your reading journal, and so that we can
learn more about you, your background, and your learning goals, please fill
out the [course entrance survey]({{site.data.course.urls.entrance_survey}}).
