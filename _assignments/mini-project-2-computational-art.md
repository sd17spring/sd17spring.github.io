## Introduction: Computational Creativity

The idea of this assignment is to create art using computation as an artistic
medium. As you saw in class, there are a ton of interesting ways to combine
computation and art. In this assignment you will be exploring one particular
means of using computers to generate images, and for the "going beyond"
portion you will have the opportunity to extend your work by exploring topics
such as computational generation of movies and real-time visualization of
auditory signals.

At some point in your mathematical career you have probably seen a figure that
looks like this:

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/simple_surface.png %}){:width="320px" height="249px"}

This is a graphical representation of the function f(x, y) = 2x + y where the
brightness of each position in the figure above represents the value of the
function evaluated at a particular (x, y) pair (note the bar on the side that
translates between brightness and the numerical value of the function).

From a visual point of view, this figure doesn't look particularly rich.
However, for more complex functions things start to get more interesting. Here
is a plot of the function f(x, y) = sin(10pi*xy)

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/medium_surface.png %}){:width="320px" height="243px"}

Things get even more interesting when we use the power of computation to
generate functions by randomly composing elementary functions with each other.
Here is a plot of the randomly generated function f(x, y) =
cos(pi*((cos(pi*sin(pi*(((x+y)/2.0*cos(pi*y))+cos(pi*cos(pi*y)))/2.0))*((((cos(pi*y)+(x*y))/2.0*(cos(pi*y)*sin(pi*x)))+sin(pi*((x+x)/2.0+cos(pi*y))/2.0))/2.0*sin(pi*sin(pi*sin(pi*(y+y)/2.0)))))+sin(pi*(cos(pi*cos(pi*cos(pi*sin(pi*x))))+sin(pi*sin(pi*((x*x)*sin(pi*y)))))/2.0))/2.0)

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/complex_singlechannel_surface.png %}){:width="320px" height="244px"}

Cool! Next, we bring in the idea of color. Instead of generating one random
function, we generate three (one for each of the color channels red, green,
and blue). Here are 3 figures representing randomly generated functions for
each of the color channels. (Note: in a slight change of notation we are now
using the function avg(x, y) instead of (x + y) / 2.0)

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/complex_red_surface.png %}){:width="320px" height="239px"}

```python
red(x, y) = sin(pi * avg((((cos(pi * (sin(pi * cos(pi * y)) * avg(avg(x, x),
sin(pi * y)))) * avg(sin(pi * (sin(pi * y) * (y * x))), cos(pi * cos(pi * (y *
y))))) * sin(pi * (sin(pi * (sin(pi * y) * sin(pi * y))) * cos(pi * ((y * y) *
sin(pi * y)))))) * sin(pi * avg(cos(pi * avg(((y * x) * (x * x)), sin(pi * (y
* x)))), sin(pi * avg(avg(sin(pi * x), avg(x, x)), sin(pi * avg(x, y))))))),
cos(pi * cos(pi * avg(sin(pi * sin(pi * avg((x * x), (x * x)))), sin(pi *
sin(pi * sin(pi * sin(pi * y)))))))))
```

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/complex_green_surface.png %}){:width="320px" height="237px"}

```python
green(x, y) = sin(pi * ((avg(avg(cos(pi * (cos(pi * cos(pi * x)) * (cos(pi * x)
* avg(y, x)))), ((cos(pi * cos(pi * y)) * (cos(pi * x) * (x * y))) * sin(pi *
sin(pi * avg(y, y))))), cos(pi * (avg(sin(pi * sin(pi * x)), sin(pi * sin(pi *
x))) * sin(pi * sin(pi * (x * y)))))) * avg((avg(cos(pi * sin(pi * cos(pi *
x))), avg((sin(pi * x) * cos(pi * y)), avg(cos(pi * x), cos(pi * x)))) *
avg(avg(sin(pi * cos(pi * x)), sin(pi * sin(pi * x))), (avg(cos(pi * x),
avg(y, x)) * avg(sin(pi * y), sin(pi * x))))), (cos(pi * cos(pi * (avg(y, y) *
(y * x)))) * cos(pi * cos(pi * sin(pi * avg(x, x))))))) * sin(pi *
avg(avg(sin(pi * cos(pi * sin(pi * cos(pi * x)))), avg(sin(pi * cos(pi *
cos(pi * y))), ((sin(pi * y) * (x * y)) * cos(pi * (y * y))))), cos(pi *
avg(((cos(pi * y) * (y * y)) * avg(sin(pi * y), cos(pi * y))), (((x * x) *
avg(y, x)) * cos(pi * sin(pi * x)))))))))
```

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/complex_blue_surface.png %}){:width="320px" height="240px"}

```python
blue(x, y) = avg(sin(pi * (avg(cos(pi * avg((cos(pi * (x * x)) * cos(pi * (x *
y))), avg(avg((x * x), avg(y, y)), avg(cos(pi * y), cos(pi * x))))),
avg(avg(avg((sin(pi * y) * (x * y)), sin(pi * (x * x))), avg(((x * x) * sin(pi
* y)), (avg(x, x) * sin(pi * y)))), avg((cos(pi * sin(pi * y)) * cos(pi *

x) * sin(pi * x)), cos(pi * sin(pi * y)))) * avg(sin(pi * (avg(y, x) * avg(x,
x))), cos(pi * avg((y * y), avg(y, y)))))))))
```

Of course the real fun is when we put all of these individual color channel
images together into a single image.

![]({% link images/homeworks/homework-4/extra2.png %})

Voila! Computational creativity (there are some deep philosophical issues
behind whether this can be called creativity... We don't pretend to know the
answers, but we do think that these pictures look really cool!)

Here are some other examples taken from students who have done this assignment
at Harvey Mudd:

## Part 0: Install and test Python Imaging Library

In order to get started on the assignment, you should fork the [base
repository](https://github.com//{{site.data.course.github.owner_name}}/ComputationalArt) for the
computational art mini-project. Once you've forked the repository, clone the
repository on your computer. If you clone the repository in your home
directory, the starter code will be in `ComputationalArt/recursive_art.py`. In
addition to fetching the starter code, you should also install the [Pillow
fork](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/) of the Python Imaging Library
("PIL"). To do so, execute the following command at the Linux terminal:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install Pillow
```

The starter code includes a function called `test_image` that uses PIL to
generate an image where each pixel has a random color value. When you run the
starter code, you should see several unit test failures from functions you
will implement later, and it should save an image file named `noise.png` in
your run directory. You can view `noise.png` using the built-in tool
`image_viewer`.

[![Random pixel noise]({% link images/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/noise.png %}){:width="320px" height="320px"}]({% link images/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/noise.png %})

While this looks pretty cool (and it might be fun to convince your gullible
friends it is a Magic Eye picture), I wouldn't call it _art_. In the rest of
the assignment, you will combine randomness with structure to produce more
compelling images.

Once you've verified that PIL is working correctly, comment out the line that
calls `test_image` and un-comment the line that calls `generate_art`. If you
run into errors installing Pillow or generating the test image, talk to a
NINJA.

## Part 1: Understanding the structure of the starter code and making your first image

First, make sure you are familiar with the starter code and how it utilizes
the PIL library to generate a simple image. The relevant code is in the
`generate_art` function:

```python
# Functions for red, green, and blue channels - where the magic happens!
red_function = ["x"]
green_function = ["y"]
blue_function = ["x"]

# Create image and loop over all pixels
im = Image.new("RGB", (x_size, y_size))
pixels = im.load()
for i in range(x_size):
    for j in range(y_size):
        x = remap_interval(i, 0, x_size, -1, 1)
        y = remap_interval(j, 0, y_size, -1, 1)
        pixels[i, j] = (
            color_map(evaluate_random_function(red_function, x, y)),
            color_map(evaluate_random_function(green_function, x, y)),
            color_map(evaluate_random_function(blue_function, x, y)))

im.save(filename)
```

The arguments to this function are a string `filename` where the image file
will be saved, and two optional arguments `x_size` and `y_size` which set the
image dimensions in pixels. If the size arguments are not given, they default
to 350.

Let's look at the code line-by-line and make sure we understand what is
happening

```python
red_function = ["x"]
green_function = ["y"]
blue_function = ["x"]
```

For testing purposes we are going to generate the red channel with the
function x, the green channel with the function y, and the blue channel with
the function x. Eventually we will do more complex things as in the examples
above, but this will allow us to get started.

```python
im = Image.new("RGB", (x_size, y_size))
pixels = im.load()
```

In this code, we are creating a new image with the given size. The input "RGB"
indicates that the image has three color channels which are in order "red",
"green", and "blue". The `im.load` command returns a pixel access object that
we can use to set the color values in our new image.

```python
for i in range(x_size):
    for j in range(y_size):
```

These lines create a nested loop in which we will set each pixel value based
on evaluating the red, green, and blue channel functions.

```python
        x = remap_interval(i, 0, x_size, -1, 1)
        y = remap_interval(j, 0, y_size, -1, 1)
```

These lines are necessary because the functions we will be generating (as in
the examples above) have inputs in the interval [-1, +1] and outputs in the
interval [-1, +1]. If we were to simply input the raw pixel coordinates, these
would go from [0, 349]. The `remap_interval` function (which you will
implement) transforms the pixel index (which is in [0, 349]) to the interval we
want ([-1, +1]).

```python
        pixels[i, j] = (
            color_map(evaluate_random_function(red_function, x, y)),
            color_map(evaluate_random_function(green_function, x, y)),
            color_map(evaluate_random_function(blue_function, x, y)))
```

This code evaluates each the red, green, and blue channel functions to obtain
the intensity for each color channel for the pixel (i, j). We need to use the
`color_map` function (which calls your `remap_interval` function) since the
color channel function outputs are floats in [-1, +1], but PIL expects the
color intensity values to be integers in the range [0, 255].

```python
im.save(filename)
```

This final line saves your image to disk as the specified filename (which will
be `"myart.png"` if you don't change it). You can view `myart.png` using the
built-in tool `image_viewer`.

**The initial starter code will not work without modification.**
To get started and generate your first image, you will need to make the following modifications:

1. Implement `remap_interval`. To help you get started we have defined several doctests and filled out the docstring.
2. Modify the function `evaluate_random_function` so that if the function ["x"] is passed in, the input argument x is returned, and if the function ["y"] is passed in, the input argument y is returned. To help you understand this, we have added two doctests demonstrating the behavior your function should have.

If you have done everything properly, when you run your code you shouldn't get
any doctest failure messages and an image file will show up in your
`computational_art`  folder called `myart.png`. The image should look like this:

[![]({% link images/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/myart.png %})]({% link images/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/myart.png %})

## Part 2: Generating and evaluating random recursive functions

Now that you have created your first image, you should start filling out the
function `build_random_function`. As you fill in this function, you will also
want to modify your `evaluate_random_function` method so that it can handle
the recursive functions that `build_random_function` is generating.

In order to be able to see the images your code is generating as you make
these changes, you should overwrite the simple function values for red, green,
and blue in the body of `generate_art` with random functions generated with
minimum depth 7 and maximum depth 9 (definitely play around with other depths
for really cool effects though). The modified code should look like this:

```python
red_function = build_random_function(7, 9)
green_function = build_random_function(7, 9)
blue_function = build_random_function(7, 9)
```

We will be representing function composition using nested lists. Here is a
scheme for representing function compositions using a list:

```python
["elementary function name here", argument 1 (optional), argument 2 (optional)]
```

For instance, to represent the function f(x, y) = x we would use (you have
already seen this in the first part of the assignment):

```python
["x"]
```

Since the function f(x, y) = x has no additional arguments, the 2nd and 3rd
elements of the list have been omitted. Note, that the string "x" has no
special meaning to Python, in the first part of the assignment you had to tell
Python how to evaluate this function for a particular input pair (x, y).

Alternatively, consider the following list representation of the function
f(x, y) = sin(pi * x)

```python
["sin_pi", ["x"]]
```

In contrast to the function f(x, y) = x, here we use the second list element to
specify the function that we are going to compose with `sin_pi`.

Next, consider the following representation of the function f(x, y) = xy

```python
["prod", ["x"], ["y"]]
```

In this example we used both the second and third element to specify the two
arguments to the prod function.

To create more complex functions we use more deeply-nested lists. For
instance, f(x, y) = sin(pi*x)*cos(pi*x) would be represented as:

```python
["prod", ["sin_pi", ["x"]], ["cos_pi", ["x"]]]
```

Implement the function `build_random_function` in the provided Python file
`recursive_art.py`.

The two input arguments to `build_random_function` are `min_depth` and
`max_depth`. The input `min_depth` specifies the minimum amount of nesting for
the function that you generate (the depth of the preceding examples are 2 and
3 respectively). The input `max_depth` specifies the maximum amount of nesting
of the function that you generate. To help better understand the idea of the
depth of the function the following diagram might help:

[![Depth tree diagram]({% link images/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/treediagram.jpg %})]({% link images/assignments/mini-project-2-computational-art/treediagram.jpg %})

**Click image to enlarge**

In this figure the nested function is represented as a tree. The elementary
functions are represented in the label on the relevant box, and an arrow from
box i to box j indicates that the function represented by box j is an argument
to the function represented by box i. To the left of each box is the list
representation of the function (notice that the list representation includes
the function representation of the functions that it points to). Also to the
left of the box is the depth of the function (i.e. the degree of nested-ness of
the list representation). The `min_depth` and `max_depth` inputs, refer to the
depths listed in the figure above.

Your `build_random_function` implementation should create random functions
from the following required building blocks:

* `prod(a, b) = ab`
* `avg(a, b) = 0.5*(a + b)`
* `cos_pi(a) = cos(pi * a)`
* `sin_pi(a) = sin(pi * a)`
* `x(a, b) = a`
* `y(a, b) = b`

The key characteristic of each of these building blocks is that provided each
of the inputs specified to the function is in the range [-1, 1] then the output
of the function will also be in the range [-1, 1]. In addition to the required
functions above, **add two additional function building blocks**  that have the
crucial property that if the inputs to the function are between [-1, 1] the
output will also be in the interval [-1, 1]. As part of creating
`build_random_function` you should add an appropriate docstring. You may also
want to add additional doctests. Your implementation of
`build_random_function` should make heavy use of the principle of
[recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion).

As stated before, as you modify `build_random_function` you will also want to
modify the implementation of `evaluate_random_function` that you created in **Part 1** .
In order to complete the required part of the assignment, your
`evaluate_random_function` must be able to evaluate any random function
generated by `build_random_function`.

## Going Beyond

There are a number of interesting directions to take this assignment.

### Extension 1: Lambda Functions!

Explore the use of [lambda functions](http://www.secnetix.de/%7Eolli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk) to
represent deeply nested compositions of functions. For this extension you
should replace the list representation of nested functions with lambda
functions. For instance, `["cos_pi", ["prod", ["x", "y"]]]` would be
represented as the lambda function:

```python
lambda x, y: cos(pi * (lambda x, y: (lambda x, y: x)(x, y) * (lambda x, y: y)(x, y))(x, y)).
```

Using lambda functions will allow you to return a variable of type function
from your `build_random_function` code. In order to evaluate the function at
a particular (x, y) pair all you have to do is pass (x, y) into your function
variable (this obviates the need for `evaluate_random_function`). For
instance,

```python
green = build_random_function(7, 9)
green_channel_pixel_for_x_y = green(x, y)
```

### Extension 2: Movies!!!

Instead of building random functions of two variables (x, y) build random
function of three variables (x, y, t) where t represents the frame number in a
movie rescaled to the interval [-1, +1]. The easiest way to create these movies
is to output a series of image files (one for each frame of the movie) and
then use a command line tool like `avconv` to encode them into a movie
(note: on older version of Ubuntu, such as 12.04, you should use `ffmpeg`
instead).

For instance, if you created images `frame001.png`, `frame002.png`, ...,
`frame100.png` you could encode these images into a movie using the following
command in Linux (assuming you have already installed **avconv**  via `apt-get`).

```bash
$ avconv -i frame%03d.png -vb 20M mymovie.avi
```

Use `frame%03d.png` if your files are named _e.g._  `frame001.png`, `frame002.png`,
`frame003.png`. Use `frame%d.png` if your files are named _e.g._  `frame%03d.png`,
`frame2.png`, `frame3.png`.

If you want to do something cleaner, you should investigate some libraries for
actually creating the movie within Python itself (removing the need for saving
the frames individually and running **avconv**). You can also use the [Python
`subprocess` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) to call
**avconv**  from within Python, although in this case you still need to save
the individual frames.

The results are pretty cool! Check out these examples that I created (Note:
for these examples I ran the time variable from -1 to 1 and then in reverse
from 1 to -1):

#### Extension 3: Pulsating Music Visualizer!!!!!

The idea here will be to have a visualization that responds in real-time to
loudness changes as picked up by your computer's microphone. This can be used
to have a visual that pulses along to the music (or your voice).

In order to process audio from the microphone, check out
[pyalsaaudio](http://larsimmisch.github.io/pyalsaaudio/). To use the
library you will need to install both the **pyalsaaudio**  package and some
libraries that it depends on. Here are the install commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
$ sudo pip3 install pyalsaaudio
```

Here is some simple code for getting audio from the mic and displaying the
volume:

```python
import alsaaudio
import audioop

inp = alsaaudio.PCM(alsaaudio.PCM_CAPTURE, 0)
inp.setchannels(1)
inp.setrate(16000)
inp.setformat(alsaaudio.PCM_FORMAT_S16_LE)
inp.setperiodsize(160)

while True:
    l, data = inp.read()
    if l:
        print(audioop.rms(data, 2))
```

To display images in real-time (as opposed to using an image viewer to
checkout the images after you have saved them to a file), I recommend using
**pygame** .

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install pygame
```

We are not including detailed instructions on this, but it shouldn't be too
hard for you to figure out using Google and the **pygame**  documentation. You
may also have to install some dependencies using **apt-get** :

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install mercurial python-dev python-numpy ffmpeg libsdl- image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libsdl1.2-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev
```

One very important thing is that your code will not be fast enough to generate
the appropriate image for a given volume level in real-time. You should
generate the images for various volume levels ahead of time, and have them
loaded and ready to be displayed using **pygame**  when appropriate.

## Turning in your assignment

In order to turn in your assignment, you will need to push your code to GitHub
(for the main assignment, all code will be in `recursive_art.py`. If you
choose to do the going beyond portion, it is up to you how you structure your
code for that portion). You should also push at least two images generated by
your program using the file names `example1.png` and `example2.png`  (if
you don't want to use PNG, feel free to use a different standard image
format). **The final step in submitting your mini-project is to issue a pull
request from your `ComputationalArt` repo to the `{{site.data.course.github.owner_name}}/ComputationalArt`
repo.**

### Optional in-class Gallery Show

We will be creating an art gallery of examples from the class. If you want to
participate in the gallery show, you should create a folder on the Olin Public
drive at the following location: `{{ site.data.course.mp2_gallery_public_drive_path }}`. For instance,
if your name is Jane Doe you would create a folder for your work at
`{{ site.data.course.mp2_gallery_public_drive_path }}/JaneDoe`. If you prefer to post your art
anonymously, you can do so, but please put it in a separate folder, *e.g.*
`{{ site.data.course.mp2_gallery_public_drive_path }}/anonymousartist2`). Inside this folder, you
should put your art files (either images or movies) along with a brief file
called `ARTIST_STATEMENT.txt` that contains:

* Your name (if not anonymous)
* The random functions you used to create the artwork (red, green, and blue channels)
* An artist's statement explaining your work of art.

The types of things you might want to touch on in the artist statement are:

* What is the title of your composition?
* What are the major themes explored in your piece?
* What are your major influences as an artist that lead you to create this piece?

A much better and more extensive list of guidance around producing an artist's
