4. Take the [entrance survey]({{site.course.entrance_survey_url}}) and share learning goals for the course

During class we will be going through the steps necessary to do the pre-class
exercises for the course. Specifically, we will be having everyone signup for
a GitHub account, and then find and fork the reading journal repository. In
case you want to refer back to these instructions, they are available
[here](/assignments/setup-your-environment#TOC-Step-3:-Get-
Started-with-Git).
