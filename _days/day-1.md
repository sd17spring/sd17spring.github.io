2. Course overview

4. Take the [entrance survey]({{site.data.course.urls.entrance_survey}}) and share learning goals for the course

During class we will be going through the steps necessary to do the pre-class
exercises for the course. Specifically, we will be having everyone signup for
a GitHub account, and then find and fork the reading journal repository. In
case you want to refer back to these instructions, they are available
[here]({% link _assignments/setup-your-environment.md %}#step-3-get-started-with-git).
