## Today

1. The case for interdisciplinary computer science ([pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0UHkPLHsgyoeWFQRkViT0tvREE/view?usp=sharing), [pptx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0UHkPLHsgyodHlnLV9uVjkyUEk/view?usp=sharing))
2. Course overview
3. Start on "[Get Set]({% link _assignments/setup-your-environment.md %})". There will be a "Linux Installathon" on Friday 5-7pm in the Computing Lab.
4. Take the [entrance survey]({{site.course.entrance_survey_url}}) and share learning goals for the course

During class we will be going through the steps necessary to do the pre-class
exercises for the course. Specifically, we will be having everyone signup for
a GitHub account, and then find and fork the reading journal repository. In
case you want to refer back to these instructions, they are available
[here]({% link _assignments/setup-your-environment.md %}#step-3-get-started-with-git).

## For Next Time

1. Read [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) Ch. 1-3, 5.1-5.7;
Linux at Olin Chapter 1 ([PDF download]({% link files/assignments/setup-your-environment/linux.pdf %}));
and [Amgit Chapter 1](https://github.com/AllenDowney/amgit/blob/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.markdown).
2. Submit the [Day 1 Reading Journal](step-4-do-some-reading-and-write-some-python).
