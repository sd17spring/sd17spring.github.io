## Communicating with your audience

The work you've done in this class is potentially of interest to several
different groups of people. This exercise is intended to help you select what
content to include and prioritize in your website and other deliverables.

In groups at your tables:

1. Select three potential audiences you would like your work to reach. Examples include future employers, potential users, other developers continuing your work, SoftDes staff, students learning programming, media outlets, etc.
2. For each of the three groups you've chosen, discuss at your table what sort of information that audience wants to see. Make a list of their priorities.
3. Below are several of the final project websites from a previous year. Randomly choose at least three of them, visit each putting yourself in the shoes of each of your audience groups, and take notes on what you find. Were the details you were looking for easy to find? What was missing? Where did it excel and where could it be better?

<ul>
{% for project in site.data['final-projects'].sp2016 %}
{% assign mod = forloop.index | modulo: 2 %}
{% if mod == 1 %}
<li><a href="{{ project.website }}">{{ project.name }}</a></li>
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
