## Text mining project presentations

If you'd like to share what you discovered/created as part of your text mining
project, please add ~1-2 slides to the class presentation [[SoftDes Spring 2017 spring 2017 MP3 examples]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fybuwS68fdgCHrhOMcpbDzZOfDhzUJsEiOQ_24pUQHI/edit?usp=sharing)

Professionalism is important in public presentations, so please use the "would
I be happy for my parents to read this in the newspaper" test when uploading
content. Humor is great; abusive language or disparaging groups of people is
firmly not acceptable.
