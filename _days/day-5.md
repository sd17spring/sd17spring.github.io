## Submitting Gene Finder

Submitting your Gene Finder mini project is a two step process:

1. Complete the work and push it to your GitHub repository
2. Submit a pull request to the upstream {{site.course.github_owner}} repository that you originally forked from

Pull requests are typically used to contribute code to someone else's project
in the open source world. They let you send changes you've made, which the
original author can then choose to pull in and accept. We actually like our
assignment without solutions thank you very much, so we won't be accepting
your pull requests. Instead, we use them as:

1. Your way to tell us when you're done and we should look at your assignment, and
2. A mechanism for us to provide written feedback on your code
