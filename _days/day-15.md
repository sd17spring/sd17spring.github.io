## Today

* Team formation

## Team Formation

We will continue giving the class opportunities to form groups of 4 to 5 students.

The teaching team will be available to help shape proposals for projects that are likely to meet little resistance when proposed.

By the end of today's class, your team should be [registered on the team Final Project Team
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qr068qhurZSSAcj67rtdQ1qCWML5WymOZYrl3cDzNIc/edit#gid=0).
You can also use this sheet to facilitate searching for additional team members. Highlight your name in green once you've
signed on with a team.
