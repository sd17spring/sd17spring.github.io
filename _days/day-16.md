## Project proposal review

We will be reviewing final project proposals with each team today. If you
don't have a printed out copy of your [project proposal]({% link _assignments/final-project.md %}#project-proposal), you should run
do that!

Make sure your team, including project idea and working GitHub repo, are
[registered on the team spreadsheet]({{final_project_proposal_spreadsheet}}).

When you're not meeting with the teaching team, you should:

1. [Fill out the mid-course feedback survey]({{site.course.mid_course_feedback_survey_url}}) (thanks to those of you who have done this already)
2. Work with your final project team
3. Work on the reading journal for next time
